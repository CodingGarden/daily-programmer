# Reverse a string

* Difficulty - Beginner
* Prequisites
  * Iteration / Loops
  * String manipulation

Write a function that takes in a string as an input.

Return the string with its characters in the opposite order.

You can reverse the string in place or with a new variable.

>NOTE: Try to solve this without using any built in string or array methods (split, reverse, join are all built in array methods).

```js
reverseString('hello');
// 'olleh'
reverseString('world');
// 'dlrow'
```
